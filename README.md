# QWIQ
QWIQ is a **Q**uick **W**ork **I**tem **Q**uery library for Team Foundation Server / Visual Studio Online. If you do a lot of reading or writing of work items, this package is for you! 

## What can it be used for?
Querying Team Foundation Server, of course! Instead of directly using the TFS Client OM, you could use QWIQ! It comes in two flavors: Qwiq.Core and Qwiq.Identity. Qwiq.Core is the no-frills base package, exposinnng the raw types needed to read and write work items. Qwiq.Identity adds methods to simplify converting between your preferred method of identity (display names, user names) and TFS's identity classes. Why use this over the Client OM? Glad you asked!

### 1. Easier to consume
Let's be honest, the TFS libraries are a pain to use. There are a lot of them, several are dynamically loaded, and a few are native. While we can't avoid it, you can! Just install the Qwiq.Core package and everything will be in your \bin folder when you need it.

### 2. Easier to test
Qwiq makes testing your apps a breeze. Everything has an interface. Everything uses factories (or factory methods) instead of constructors. Just mock what you need for your tests and go. No more messy, temperamental fakes, or adapters cluttering your code.

### 3. Easier to understand
How often do you update a work item? How often do you create a new security group? We stripped out the rarely used stuff to make interfaces cleaner and the relationships between types simpler. Missing something you can't live without? Send us a pull request!

## How to install it
QWIQ is composed in two libraries: Core and Identity. You can use just Core to handle work items, or bring in identity if you need that too. Just run the commands from the Package Manager console in Visual Studio.

### Install Core
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.Core
```

### Install Identity
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.Identity
```

### Using QWIQ for work items
```csharp
using Microsoft.IE.Qwiq;
using Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.Credentials;

...

var creds = CredentialsFactory
                .GetInstance()
                .CreateAadCredentials(
                	"***REMOVED***", // Visual Studio Resource String
                	"***REMOVED***", // TFS Client Id
                	"https://login.windows.net/common/");   // Identity Authority

var uri = new Uri("***REMOVED***");

var store = WorkItemStoreFactory
                .GetInstance()
                .Create(uri, creds);

var items = store.Query(@"
    SELECT [System.Id] 
    FROM WorkItems 
    WHERE WorkItemType = 'Bug' AND State = 'Active'", true);â€‹
```

```powershell
[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom("E:\Path\To\Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.Core.dll")

$credsFactory = [Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.Credentials.CredentialsFactory]::GetInstance()

# VS Resource String, TfsClientId, and Authority
$creds = $credsFactory.CreateAadCredentials(
			"***REMOVED***", 
			"***REMOVED***", 
			"https://login.windows.net/common/")

$uri = [Uri]"***REMOVED***"

$store = [Microsoft.IE.Qwiq.WorkItemStoreFactory]::GetInstance().Create($uri, $creds)

$items = $store.Query(@"
    SELECT [System.Id] 
    FROM WorkItems 
    WHERE WorkItemType = 'Bug' AND State = 'Active'", $true)
```
